# Tyre Force Simulation using the Magic Formula

# Description
This project simulates **tyre forces** using the **Pacejka Magic Formula**. The simulation computes **longitudinal force (Fx) and lateral force (Fy)** based on given slip values, vehicle mass, and friction coefficient. The results are visualized as plots.
